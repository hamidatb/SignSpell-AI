## Welcome to SignSpell-AI
SignSpell-AI is an advanced web application designed to make learning sign language accessible, engaging, and effective. Utilizing the power of artificial intelligence, this platform offers real-time gesture recognition and personalized feedback through integration with the OpenAI GPT-4 API. My aim is to create an adaptive learning environment where users can not only learn but also practice sign language interactively.

## Project Vision
My vision is to democratize the learning of sign language, making it as simple and accessible as using any everyday app. We believe in leveraging technology to break communication barriers and enrich lives, particularly in underserved communities.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Harness computer vision to decode sign language gestures in real-time, offering immediate feedback.
- **AI-Powered Adaptive Feedback**: Utilize the intelligence of OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide feedback that adapts to the user's learning pace and style, enhancing understanding and retention.
- **Interactive Learning Modules**: Engage users with interactive content that makes learning both fun and effective.
- **Progress Tracking**: Advanced tracking mechanisms to monitor user progress, allowing the application to tailor the learning experience to individual needs.

## Technology Stack
- **Flask**: Serves as the backbone of my web application, managing routes, views, and the overall server logic.
- **OpenCV**: Empowers my application with the ability to process and analyze images for gesture recognition.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API**: Provides intelligent feedback mechanisms, making the learning process more intuitive.
- **SQL Database**: Manages all data storage needs, from user information to progress tracking.
